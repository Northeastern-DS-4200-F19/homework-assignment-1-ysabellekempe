    <h1>This is what a muffin looks like.</h1>
    <img src="images/muffin.jpg" alt="Something went wrong! Oh, well.">
    <p>This is the best muffin site on the internet.
       Never go to another muffin site
      and <strong>god forbid</strong> you even <i>think</i>
       about using <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> instead. We blog about:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>chocolate chip muffins</li>
        <li>blueberry muffins</li>
        <li>corn muffins</li>
        <li>and <i>even</i> those darn pistachio muffins</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Sometimes instead of thinking about muffins, we think about the fact that a
  standard paragraph is five sentences long and that is much too long when you
are trying to come up with things to say in your DS 4200 homework.</p>
       <p>Here is a second paragraph about muffins, if there's even anything else
       to say about them. They are roundish. They taste good. You shouldn't eat
     too many or you might get some sort of disease that people get when they consume
   too many muffins.</p>
